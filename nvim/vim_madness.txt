Let's say you want to copy a few lines of code or text to register `b`:

1. **Visual Mode**: Use `V` to select whole lines.
2. **Command**: After ensuring selection, press `"by` to yank this selection into register `b`.

- **Command**: Enter Insert mode by pressing `i`.
- **Command**: Press `CTRL-R`, release it, then `a`. This will insert the text of the macro in register `a`.
