    "Approach": "Approach\n\nResearch Design\n\nThis project aims to develop NC-B8, an agonistic anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, as a novel therapeutic approach for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). The overall strategy is to obtain translational evidence using mouse models (SOD1 G93A) and human materials (postmortem brain and spinal cord, plasma samples, and motor neurons derived from iPS cells of ALS patients) to prepare for IND filing and future clinical trials against ALS.\n\nThe project is structured around three main objectives:\n1. Characterize CD38 dysregulation in human ALS and establish biomarker baselines\n2. Determine NC-B8 human dose modeling\n3. Perform preliminary safety studies\n\nNC-B8 is designed to modulate CD38 activity, potentially slowing disease progression in ALS patients. By targeting the CD38 pathway, we aim to activate whole autophagy-lysosomal flux and boost energy metabolism in suffering cells, making them effective again in the context of age-related diseases. This approach is based on our discovery of a new biological pathway that uses CD38 in an unprecedented manner, mimicking a key natural rescue mechanism impaired with aging.\n\nSpecific Aim #1: Characterize CD38 dysregulation in human ALS and establish biomarker baselines\n\nRationale: To strengthen the rationale for targeting CD38 in ALS and to inform future clinical trial design, we need to better understand CD38 expression patterns in ALS patients and establish baseline levels of relevant biomarkers.\n\nTask 1.1: Map CD38 expression in postmortem brain and spinal cord samples\n\nMethods: We will analyze postmortem brain and spinal cord samples from healthy controls and ALS patients using a combination of techniques:\n- Gene expression: RT-qPCR and RNA-seq\n- Protein expression: Western blot and immunohistochemistry\n- Metabolic analysis: NAD+ and cADPR levels using mass spectrometry\n\nInnovative approach: This comprehensive mapping will provide a holistic view of CD38 dysregulation in ALS, potentially revealing novel insights into disease mechanisms.\n\nPotential challenges and alternatives: Limited availability of high-quality postmortem samples may affect statistical power. We will collaborate with multiple brain banks to ensure sufficient sample sizes. If needed, we will supplement with animal model data.\n\nInterpretation of results: We expect to observe increased CD38 expression and activity in ALS samples, particularly in motor neurons and glial cells. This would support our hypothesis that CD38 overactivation contributes to ALS pathology.\n\nTask 1.2: Determine ALS plasma and CSF biomarker levels\n\nMethods: We will analyze plasma and CSF samples from healthy controls and ALS patients using:\n- ELISA for protein biomarkers (e.g., neurofilament light chain)\n- Mass spectrometry for metabolite biomarkers (e.g., NAD+, cADPR)\n- Multiplex cytokine assays for inflammatory markers\n\nPotential challenges and alternatives: Inter-patient variability may be high. We will use a sufficiently large sample size (n â‰¥ 50 per group) to account for this variability. If specific biomarkers prove unreliable, we will explore alternative markers based on our CD38 pathway analysis.\n\nInterpretation of results: This data will establish baseline levels and variability of biomarkers for target engagement and efficacy. We will use these results to inform sample size calculations for future clinical trials.\n\nSpecific Aim #2: Determine NC-B8 human dose modeling\n\nRationale: To optimize NC-B8 dosing for human trials, we need to establish its efficacy in human cells, understand its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and model its behavior in the human central nervous system.\n\nTask 2.1: Determine NC-B8 neuroprotective efficacy in human motor neurons\n\nMethods: We will derive motor neurons from iPS cells of ALS patients (n = 10) and healthy controls. Neurons will be treated with varying concentrations of NC-B8 and assessed for:\n- Survival (MTT assay)\n- Neurite outgrowth (high-content imaging)\n- Mitochondrial function (Seahorse assay)\n- Autophagy markers (LC3-II, p62 by Western blot)\n\nInnovative approach: Using patient-derived neurons allows for a more translational assessment of NC-B8 efficacy compared to animal models alone.\n\nPotential challenges and alternatives: iPSC-derived motor neurons may not fully recapitulate adult neuron behavior. We will validate key findings in postmortem tissue samples where possible.\n\nInterpretation of results: We will determine the EC50 of NC-B8 for neuroprotection, which will inform our dosing strategy for human trials.\n\nTask 2.2: Assess NC-B8 blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration\n\nMethods: We will use a human in vitro BBB model consisting of brain endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes. NC-B8 transport will be quantified using radiolabeled antibody and transwell assays.\n\nPotential challenges and alternatives: In vitro models may not fully represent the complexity of the human BBB. We will validate findings using in vivo imaging in animal models if necessary.\n\nInterpretation of results: We will determine the BBB penetration efficiency of NC-B8, which is crucial for estimating the dose required to achieve therapeutic concentrations in the CNS.\n\nTask 2.3: Perform PK/PD studies in mouse models\n\nMethods: We will conduct single-dose and repeated-dose PK/PD studies in wild-type and SOD1 G93A mice. We will measure:\n- NC-B8 concentrations in plasma, CSF, and CNS tissue\n- Biomarkers of target engagement (NAD+, cADPR levels)\n- Biomarkers of efficacy (neurofilament light chain, inflammatory markers)\n\nPotential challenges and alternatives: Mouse PK/PD may not directly translate to humans. We will use allometric scaling and integrate data from our human cell models to refine our predictions.\n\nInterpretation of results: These studies will provide crucial data on NC-B8 distribution, target engagement, and efficacy markers over time, informing our dosing strategy for human trials.\n\nTask 2.4: Predict NC-B8 treatment regimen for humans\n\nMethods: We will develop a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model integrating data from Tasks 2.1-2.3. This model will be used to simulate various dosing regimens and predict CNS exposure and target engagement in humans.\n\nInnovative approach: Our integrated modeling approach, combining in vitro human data with in vivo animal data, allows for more accurate translation to human dosing.\n\nPotential challenges and alternatives: PBPK models have inherent uncertainties. We will validate our model predictions against available clinical data for similar antibodies and refine the model iteratively.\n\nInterpretation of results: This task will yield a predicted optimal dosing regimen for NC-B8 in human trials, including dose level, frequency, and route of administration.\n\nSpecific Aim #3: Perform preliminary safety studies\n\nRationale: Given CD38's expression on immune cells, it is crucial to assess the potential immunomodulatory effects of NC-B8 before clinical trials.\n\nTask 3.1: Characterize NC-B8 effects on immune cell subpopulations\n\nMethods: We will isolate PBMCs from wild-type and SOD1 G93A mice, as well as from healthy human donors and ALS patients (n = 5 each). PBMCs will be treated with NC-B8 and analyzed by:\n- Flow cytometry for immune cell subpopulation changes\n- Cytokine profiling using multiplex assays\n- Gene expression analysis of key immune-related genes\n\nPotential challenges and alternatives: In vitro PBMC responses may not fully reflect in vivo immune effects. We will complement these studies with ex vivo analysis of immune cells from NC-B8-treated mice.\n\nInterpretation of results: We expect NC-B8 to have minimal impact on immune cell populations and function. Any observed changes will be carefully evaluated for potential clinical implications.\n\nTask 3.2: Perform tissue cross-reactivity studies\n\nMethods: We will conduct immunohistochemistry-based tissue cross-reactivity studies using a panel of human and animal tissues. This will help identify potential off-target binding of NC-B8 and select appropriate species for IND-enabling toxicology studies.\n\nPotential challenges and alternatives: Unexpected cross-reactivity could necessitate antibody re-engineering. We have backup antibody candidates that could be rapidly advanced if needed.\n\nInterpretation of results: These studies will inform the design of our IND-enabling toxicology studies and help assess the potential for off-target effects in humans.\n\nProject Timetable\n\nMonth 1-6: Aim 1 - CD38 mapping and biomarker baseline establishment\nMonth 3-12: Aim 2 - NC-B8 efficacy in human neurons and BBB penetration studies\nMonth 9-18: Aim 2 - Mouse PK/PD studies and human dose modeling\nMonth 15-24: Aim 3 - Preliminary safety studies\nMonth 22-24: Data analysis, reporting, and IND preparation\n\nFuture Directions\n\nUpon completion of this project, we will have:\n1. Established the role of CD38 dysregulation in ALS pathology\n2. Determined the optimal dosing regimen for NC-B8 in humans\n3. Gathered preliminary safety data to support IND filing\n\nFuture steps will include:\n1. IND-enabling GLP toxicology studies\n2. GMP manufacturing of NC-B8 for clinical trials\n3. Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers and ALS patients\n4. Development of companion diagnostics based on identified biomarkers\n\nThese efforts will pave the way for Phase 2 efficacy trials and potential breakthrough therapy for ALS patients.",
    "Innovation": "Innovation\n\nChallenge to current paradigms:\nThis application challenges the current paradigm in ALS treatment by targeting CD38, a novel and unexplored pathway in neurodegenerative diseases. While most ALS therapies focus on symptom management or targeting single pathways, our approach aims to address multiple underlying mechanisms simultaneously. By activating CD38, we propose to enhance cellular autophagy and energy metabolism, potentially slowing disease progression and improving neuronal function in ALS patients.\n\nNovel concepts:\nOur project introduces several novel concepts in ALS research and treatment:\n\n1. Agonistic anti-CD38 antibody (NC-B8): This first-in-class brain-penetrant antibody represents a new therapeutic modality for neurodegenerative diseases. By mimicking a key natural rescue mechanism impaired with aging, NC-B8 offers a unique approach to ALS treatment.\n\n2. Dual-action mechanism: NC-B8 not only increases NAD+ levels but also activates the entire autophagy-lysosomal flux, addressing both energy metabolism and protein aggregation issues in ALS.\n\n3. Translational biomarkers: We propose to develop and validate novel biomarkers for target engagement and efficacy, which will be crucial for future clinical trials and personalized medicine approaches in ALS.\n\nRefinements and improvements:\nOur project builds upon and refines existing knowledge in several ways:\n\n1. Improved target specificity: By focusing on CD38, we refine the approach of targeting NAD+ metabolism, potentially offering greater efficacy and fewer side effects compared to broader NAD+ precursor therapies.\n\n2. Enhanced BBB penetration: NC-B8 is designed to cross the blood-brain barrier more effectively than existing ALS therapies, potentially improving central nervous system target engagement.\n\n3. Optimized antibody engineering: Through affinity maturation and humanization processes, we aim to improve upon the initial NC-B8 antibody, enhancing its potency, safety, and translational potential for human use.\n\nBy combining these innovative approaches, our project has the potential to significantly advance ALS treatment and provide new insights into neurodegenerative disease mechanisms.",
    "Significance": "Significance\n\nBackground\nAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive motor neuron loss, leading to muscle weakness, paralysis, and ultimately death. With a global prevalence of 32 million patients, projected to reach 150 million by 2050, ALS represents a critical unmet medical need. The disease's rapid progression, with an average survival of 3-5 years post-diagnosis, underscores the urgent necessity for effective treatments.\n\nCurrent therapeutic options for ALS are limited and primarily focus on symptom management rather than disease modification. The two FDA-approved drugs, riluzole and edaravone, offer only modest benefits in survival and functional outcomes. This stark reality highlights the critical need for novel therapeutic approaches that can significantly alter disease progression and improve patient quality of life.\n\nScientific Rigor\nRecent advances in ALS research have shed light on the complex pathophysiology of the disease, implicating multiple mechanisms including protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. Among these, the role of autophagy dysfunction and metabolic impairments in an aging context has gained significant attention. Genetic, histopathological, and experimental evidence strongly support the hypothesis that aggregation of misfolded proteins in ALS is a consequence of autophagy dysfunctions and metabolism impairments.\n\nOur research has identified CD38 as a novel target in ALS pathophysiology. CD38 is a multifunctional enzyme involved in NAD+ metabolism and calcium signaling, processes crucial for cellular energy homeostasis and autophagy regulation. Preliminary data from our lab, using both in vitro and in vivo models, have demonstrated the potential of CD38 modulation in addressing key pathological features of ALS.\n\nIn vitro studies using three distinct models, including iPSC-derived motor neurons, have shown promising results in terms of neuroprotection and autophagy enhancement. Furthermore, our in vivo studies using the SOD1 G93A mouse model, widely recognized as the gold standard for ALS research, have provided compelling evidence for the efficacy of our approach. These studies have established a clear PK/PD relationship with biomarkers of efficacy and target engagement, strengthening the scientific premise of our project.\n\nState-of-the-art\nOur proposed project aims to advance the field of ALS therapeutics by targeting the CD38 pathway, a novel approach that addresses fundamental cellular processes implicated in ALS pathogenesis. By developing NC-B8, an agonistic anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, we are pioneering a first-in-class therapeutic strategy that has the potential to modify disease progression significantly.\n\nThis approach represents a paradigm shift from current symptomatic treatments to a disease-modifying therapy. Our focus on enhancing autophagy and improving cellular energy metabolism through CD38 modulation offers a unique opportunity to address multiple pathological features of ALS simultaneously. This strategy aligns with the growing understanding of ALS as a multifaceted disorder requiring multi-targeted therapeutic approaches.\n\nProposed solution\nThe successful development of NC-B8 has the potential to revolutionize ALS treatment by:\n\n1. Providing a novel mechanism of action: Unlike existing therapies, NC-B8 targets the CD38 pathway, activating a natural rescue mechanism that is impaired with aging while also increasing NAD+ levels. This dual action addresses both autophagy dysfunction and metabolic impairments, two key contributors to ALS pathology.\n\n2. Offering broader therapeutic effects: By enhancing whole autophagy-lysosomal flux activation and boosting energy metabolism, NC-B8 has the potential to improve the function of multiple cell types affected in ALS, not just motor neurons.\n\n3. Demonstrating superior efficacy: Our preliminary data suggest that NC-B8 could offer significantly greater benefits in terms of disease progression and survival compared to current standards of care.\n\n4. Providing a platform for treating other neurodegenerative diseases: The mechanisms targeted by NC-B8 are relevant to multiple neurodegenerative disorders, potentially opening avenues for broader therapeutic applications.\n\nOur proposed research aims to further characterize the role of CD38 in ALS pathology using human samples, optimize NC-B8 for clinical use through human dose modeling, and conduct preliminary safety studies. These steps are crucial for translating our promising preclinical findings into a viable clinical candidate, potentially offering hope to millions of ALS patients worldwide."
