Issue

We would like to make a few modifications on the "files added" bar:
On the section "grants links" > we are adding a text box, that can enable the strategist to insert free text if she wants to.

Backend:
  This is optional field
  In case this is added, we save it as "grant_added_scope"
  LLM - In case this is added it will be taken part of the grant outline data

On the section of "files added"
Replace text in button to "add files" instead of "upload files"
The button will open the popup (as today), though the popup is modified as follows:
We will have a toggle to switch between "company files" and "Project files"
Company files:
  user will be able to view all the files added under company files
  user will be able to add files from either: Sharepoint | Upload | insert text
  File added will be classified as "company file" as well
Project files:
  User will select the project from the list of company projects
  Dropdown, single select
  user will be able to view all the files added under the selected project
If the user selected the project that is allocated to the application pager:
  all the existing project files will be already added to the bar (he can see them again in the popup)
  user will be able to add files from either: Sharepoint | Upload | insert text
  File added will be classified as:
IF the project selected is the one related to the application pager: saved as "project files"
  If the user selected a project that is different from the one allocated to the pager:
    The user can view all the existing project files for this project
    User can add one or more files from the existing ones. These will be tagged as "other files"
    User can add new files, it will be saved internally under the selected project files; classify the file added to the list as "other files"
