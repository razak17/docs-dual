1. The most important historical event is the Mexican Revolution.

2. According to Adolfo Vazquez, the exile does not find himself as in his own land in the new one that welcomes him. This will only be his land, and he will be so in time, not as a gift that he meets upon his arrival, but to the extent that he shares the hopes and sufferings of the inhabitants of it.

3. The Mexican Revolution, which took place between 1910 and 1920, was a complex conflict that radically transformed Mexico. It began as an uprising against the dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz and evolved into a multifaceted struggle with leaders such as Emiliano Zapata, Pancho Villa and Venustiano Carranza.

Politically, it overthrew Díaz in 1911 and led to the promulgation of a new Constitution in 1917, establishing significant reforms regarding land, labor rights and education. Culturally, the Mexican Revolution inspired a wave of artistic and literary expressions that promoted national identity.

Despite its advances, the Revolution also generated prolonged internal conflicts and did not solve all of Mexico's problems. However, his legacy endures in Mexican politics, culture and collective memory.

4. The activities of the Mexican exiles living in Cuba include the communication they maintained with the large group of exiles in the United States, constitutionalist diplomats, and journalistic work.

5. The reflection "thinking in exile is a form of border thinking" is deeply evocative and raises several layers of meaning. Firstly, it is suggested that exile, whether forced or chosen, entails an experience that places it in a liminal space, in a geographical and cultural limit. This "border thinking" involves a constant negotiation of identities and a keen sensitivity to the intersection of cultures.

Exile often prompts people to reevaluate their own identity and their relationship with their country of origin. Physical borders become mental borders, and exiles may feel torn between two worlds. This leads to a type of critical thinking and self-examination, where cultural roots, social norms and political ideologies are questioned.

Additionally, "frontier thinking" can also refer to the ability to transcend the limitations of a single cultural perspective. Exiles often adopt a more open and cosmopolitan mindset, as they are forced to interact with different cultures and adapt to diverse environments. This experience can enrich your worldview and foster empathy toward others.

The reflection also suggests that exile can be a source of creativity. Many famous writers, artists and thinkers have produced masterpieces influenced by their experiences in exile. By being in a liminal place, on the border between two worlds, they can find new perspectives and approaches to address universal problems.

In short, “thinking about exile as a form of border thinking” highlights the complexity of the exile experience and how it can enrich the mind, identity, and creativity. It is a reminder that physical and cultural boundaries can be sources of intellectual and emotional growth.
6. The main objective of the struggle of Mexican exiles in Cuba is social justice and democracy in their country of origin.
